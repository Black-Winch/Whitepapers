In this way, a circular mindset enables businesses to thrive in an ever-changing and complex world. 2. Linear VS Circular Mindset in the Consumer Decision Journey The difference between linear and circular thinking in the context of the consumer decision journey lies in how they conceptualize and approach the process of making purchasing decisions. Let's explore these two mindsets: Linear Thinking \u25cf Sequential Progression: Linear thinking views the consumer decision journey as a step-by-step, linear progression from problem recognition to information search, evaluation, purchase, and post-purchase evaluation. It assumes that consumers follow a structured path and that their decisions move in a linear sequence. \u25cf Funnel Model: Linear thinking is often associated with the traditional \"funnel\" model. In this model, consumers start with a broad set of options and then narrow down their choices through each stage of the funnel, with the ultimate goal of reaching a single purchasing decision. www.blackwinch.eu Page 4 ","showCover":true,"comments":{},"guidelines":[],"lock":{"addElements":false,"removeElements":false,"reorderElements":false,"preventUnlock":false},"notes":{},"products":[]},"NS2953HG4hYC5fnG":{"id":"NS2953HG4hYC5fnG","type":"pdf","source":{"hash":"34a8cd85e0893b558c282di142302505","page":7},"width":795,"height":1123,"hash":"","version":"1","elements":[{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"NS2953HG4hYC5fnG","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":320,"width":606,"height":344},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UXtRwTA2VxY&list=PLPmptctMxw6rcgiqHvm4Mr4FxaI-LjUhC&index=5","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":false,"isAnnotation":true,"target":"_blank"},"zIndex":7,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":7,"alpha":0.3,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"ALPHA","pageId":"NS2953HG4hYC5fnG","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":1058,"width":121,"height":15},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":false,"isAnnotation":false,"target":"_blank"},"zIndex":8,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":8,"alpha":0,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"NS2953HG4hYC5fnG","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":1058,"width":121,"height":15},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":true,"isAnnotation":false},"zIndex":22,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":22,"alpha":0.3,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"NS2953HG4hYC5fnG","lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":97,"y":307,"width":618,"height":360},"action":23,"attributes":{"showOptions":false,"tooltip":"Video widget","src":"","providerId":"","provider":"","radius":3,"ytlink":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UXtRwTA2VxY&list=PLPmptctMxw6rcgiqHvm4Mr4FxaI-LjUhC&index=5&rel=1&controls=1&mute=1&autoplay=1&loop=0&start=0","cover":"","version":0,"subType":""},"zIndex":39,"icon":{"default":{"id":"108"}},"type":46,"groupId":0,"id":39,"loading":false,"alpha":1,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"forceSave":false,"update":"COLOR","pageId":"NS2953HG4hYC5fnG","lock":{},"invisible":false,"radius":3,"bounds":{"x":61,"y":131,"width":23,"height":23},"preventSave":true,"action":12,"attributes":{"shape":"rounded","tooltip":"","color":"#e87131","fontWeight":"inherit","text":"Personalization can reduce acquisition costs by as much as 50% (McKinsey)","font":{"family":"f0ce485b0-a158-4c55-a032-fc85816f76b5"},"url":"","fontSize":14,"radius":50,"textPosition":"left","alpha":1,"textboxSize":"138,29"},"zIndex":80,"icon":{"default":{"id":"110"},"active":{"id":"110"}},"type":29,"groupId":0,"id":80,"alpha":1,"rotation":0,"group":false}],"bgColor":"","extractedText":"user behavior and preferences.

It fuels the circularity of the relationship by driving continuous improvements. Manufacturers can identify areas that require enhancements and swiftly implement changes to ensure that the product or service remains aligned with customer expectations.

The younger generation, in particular, expects this level of service as the norm. They are accustomed to personalized experiences and expect businesses to cater to their individual needs. By leveraging the power of these innovative tools, supercharged by AI, and seamlessly integrating them into the sales proposal process, manufacturers can not only meet these expectations but also propel their growth and foster stronger customer loyalty.

These forward-thinking manufacturers prioritize trust as a strategic asset, nurturing it through consistent engagement, active listening, and responsive adaptation to their customers' ever-shifting needs. This focus on trust not only cements existing relationships but also paves the way for the formation of long-term, collaborative partnerships. The Value of Customer-Centricity and Enhanced Satisfaction: A circular mindset places immense emphasis on aligning business strategies with the dynamic needs and expectations of the customer. Manufacturers who adopt this approach recognize that customers are not static entities; they evolve, and their requirements change over time. By maintaining a deep understanding of these changing customer dynamics, these manufacturers consistently tailor their products, services, and interactions to deliver greater value. This continuous focus on customer satisfaction creates a virtuous cycle, as satisfied customers are more likely to become loyal patrons, advocates, and a source of invaluable word-of-mouth referrals. Manufacturers, in turn, benefit from increased customer retention and a stronger market presence.

Shift from Linear to Circular Thinking in Business Adopting a circular mindset in business means shifting the focus from a linear trajectory to a continuous cycle of learning and improvement. Instead of viewing problems as obstacles to overcome, businesses with a circular mindset see them as opportunities for growth and development. In a linear thinking approach, businesses often follow a rigid path from problem identification to solution implementation. This approach assumes that there is a single correct solution and that success is achieved by reaching that endpoint. However, this linear approach can be limiting and may not allow for flexibility or adaptation when unexpected challenges arise. On the other hand, a circular mindset recognizes that business is not a straight line but rather a continuous cycle. It acknowledges that there will be ups and downs, setbacks and breakthroughs, and that success is not a fixed destination but an ongoing process. This mindset encourages businesses to embrace the journey itself, rather than solely focusing on the end result. By adopting a circular mindset, businesses can approach challenges with a sense of curiosity and openness. They understand that there may be multiple paths to success and that failure is not a permanent setback but an opportunity to learn and improve. This mindset encourages experimentation, innovation, and continuous learning. In a circular mindset, businesses are not afraid to make course corrections along the way. They understand that the initial plan may need to be adjusted based on new information or changing circumstances. This flexibility allows businesses to adapt and evolve, ensuring their long-term sustainability. Furthermore, a circular mindset encourages businesses to view their stakeholders as part of a larger ecosystem. Instead of focusing solely on their own success, businesses with a circular mindset consider the impact of their decisions on customers, employees, www.blackwinch.eu Page 3 ","showCover":true,"comments":{},"guidelines":[],"lock":{"addElements":false,"removeElements":false,"reorderElements":false,"preventUnlock":false},"notes":{},"products":[]},"yGBRrEkTUyMVqVVg":{"id":"yGBRrEkTUyMVqVVg","type":"pdf","source":{"hash":"34a8cd85e0893b558c282di142302505","page":8},"width":795,"height":1123,"hash":"","version":"1","elements":[{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"ALPHA","pageId":"yGBRrEkTUyMVqVVg","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":1058,"width":121,"height":15},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":false,"isAnnotation":false,"target":"_blank"},"zIndex":9,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":9,"alpha":0,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"yGBRrEkTUyMVqVVg","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":1058,"width":121,"height":15},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":true,"isAnnotation":false},"zIndex":23,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":23,"alpha":0.3,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"yGBRrEkTUyMVqVVg","lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":83,"y":154,"width":636,"height":358},"action":16,"attributes":{"src":"3e8d915f97a1e3e22899918f45313908","providerId":"","scaleMode":"none","provider":"","radius":0,"interaction":{},"thumb":"","format":"gif","subType":"upload"},"zIndex":40,"icon":{},"type":37,"groupId":0,"id":40,"alpha":1,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"COLOR","pageId":"yGBRrEkTUyMVqVVg","lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":83,"y":174,"width":647,"height":318},"action":30,"attributes":{"color":"#ffffff","tooltip":"Click to view image","spotlightImageUrl":"c449f965b8d7e6011e06e05f45377449","spotlightImageWidth":1920,"spotlightImageHeight":1080,"showOptions":false,"loading":false},"zIndex":42,"icon":{"default":{"id":"138"}},"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":42,"alpha":0,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"COLOR","pageId":"yGBRrEkTUyMVqVVg","lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":732,"width":38.57142857142857,"height":38.57142857142857},"action":29,"attributes":{"buttonLabel":"Visit our website for other best practices","color":"#cb6e14","media":[{"name":"Screenshot 2024-01-23 at 14.43.19.png","hash":"e70a3b6a2dbdfb67836f98bf45378710"}],"discountPrice":"","price":"","url":"https:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","radius":3,"title":"Best practice 1","loading":false,"description":"Implement quarterly steering committees as a standard practice.

But what if we could view the contract expiration date as an opportunity rather than a burden? What if the entire rental refresh proposal process could be automated? Let's consider the essential features that will likely become the foundation for future refresh sales proposals, enabling businesses to generate more revenue and increase customer retention. Remember that increasing customer retention rates by just 5% can increase profits by 25% to 95%, according to Bain & Company, so that\u2019s of tremendous importance. 1. With the ability to send automatic personalized proposals based on customers' initial monthly fees, salespeople could revolutionize the way they engage with clients. No longer limited to generic offers, they could tailor their proposals to each individual's specific needs and budget. This level of personalization would not only make customers feel valued, but it would also increase the likelihood of them accepting the offer. A survey by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services found that 74% of consumers are more likely to buy from a company that offers a personalized experience. 2. By effortlessly offering upgraded devices at the same price, salespeople could provide customers with the latest technology without stretching their budget. This would not only elevate the overall customer experience but would also show empathy towards customers' financial constraints. As per McKinsey, 70% of buying experiences are influenced by how customers perceive their treatment. What\u2019s important to note here is that by beginning the negotiation process with the customer's monthly fee in mind, manufacturers could guarantee a steady and reliable stream of recurring revenue. This approach would be made possible through the utilization of an extensive dataset and robust reporting capabilities. 3. Additionally, having instant access to complex financial calculations would empower salespeople to offer enticing upsell opportunities much faster. By swiftly determining the financial implications of an upgrade, they could present customers with compelling and relevant offers that would align with their budget and needs. 4. To elevate the refresh strategy to new heights, sales people would need a platform that crafts automatic proposals tailored to each customer's credit scoring. No longer will valuable time be squandered on doomed proposals that face rejection from the funding team. By integrating a credit scoring system into a platform, the entire process would become seamless, guaranteeing that every proposal would not only be expedited but would also be meaningful to all parties involved. 5. Finally, real-time stock tracking would play a crucial role in building tailored proposals. With up-to-date information on inventory levels, salespeople could create proposals that would not only be relevant but also feasible in terms of product availability. www.blackwinch.eu Page 13 ","showCover":true,"comments":{},"guidelines":[],"lock":{"addElements":false,"removeElements":false,"reorderElements":false,"preventUnlock":false},"notes":{},"products":[]},"p_aAZ3OJDvFejJxEOUSis":{"bgColor":"#000000","comments":{},"elements":[{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"p_aAZ3OJDvFejJxEOUSis","lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":319,"y":881,"width":171,"height":130},"action":16,"attributes":{"src":"2795d27b7b438dbfaeaa840f45378934","providerId":"","scaleMode":"none","provider":"","radius":0,"interaction":{},"thumb":"","format":"png","subType":"upload"},"zIndex":65,"icon":{},"type":37,"groupId":0,"id":65,"alpha":1,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"ALPHA","pageId":"p_aAZ3OJDvFejJxEOUSis","lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":283,"y":854,"width":244,"height":183},"action":0,"attributes":{"tooltip":"Outline","color":"#ffffff","target":"_blank","showOptions":true,"url":"https:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu"},"zIndex":67,"icon":{"default":{"id":"100"}},"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":67,"alpha":0,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"COLOR","pageId":"p_aAZ3OJDvFejJxEOUSis","lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":413.14,"y":1050.037142857143,"width":44.15,"height":44.15},"action":0,"attributes":{"tooltip":"Go to URL","color":"#ffffff","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@blackwinch\/videos","target":"_blank","radius":3},"zIndex":68,"icon":{"default":{"id":"123"}},"type":10,"groupId":0,"id":68,"alpha":1,"rotation":0,"group":true},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"COLOR","pageId":"p_aAZ3OJDvFejJxEOUSis","lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":356,"y":1050.037142857143,"width":44.15,"height":44.15},"action":0,"attributes":{"tooltip":"Go to URL","color":"#ffffff","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/blackwinch","target":"_blank","radius":3},"zIndex":69,"icon":{"default":{"id":"124"}},"type":9,"groupId":0,"id":69,"alpha":1,"rotation":0,"group":true}],"guidelines":[],"hash":"8cb7c6f6-0e20-4fee-93d5-1f44ab300a44","height":1123,"id":"p_aAZ3OJDvFejJxEOUSis","lock":{"addElements":false,"removeElements":false,"reorderElements":false,"preventUnlock":false},"notes":{},"products":[],"showCover":true,"source":{"hash":"34a8cd85e0893b558c282di142302505","page":"p_aAZ3OJDvFejJxEOUSis"},"type":"custom","version":"","width":795},"U3ymXf5BcQviOmmZ":{"id":"U3ymXf5BcQviOmmZ","type":"pdf","source":{"hash":"34a8cd85e0893b558c282di142302505","page":11},"width":795,"height":1123,"hash":"","version":"1","elements":[{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"ALPHA","pageId":"U3ymXf5BcQviOmmZ","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":1058,"width":121,"height":15},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":false,"isAnnotation":false,"target":"_blank"},"zIndex":12,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":12,"alpha":0,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"U3ymXf5BcQviOmmZ","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":1058,"width":121,"height":15},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":true,"isAnnotation":false},"zIndex":26,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":26,"alpha":0.3,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"U3ymXf5BcQviOmmZ","lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":95,"y":282,"width":640,"height":373},"action":23,"attributes":{"showOptions":false,"tooltip":"Video widget","src":"","providerId":"","provider":"","radius":3,"ytlink":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E_MasNN35Ao&rel=1&controls=1&mute=1&autoplay=1&loop=0&start=0","cover":"","version":0,"subType":""},"zIndex":52,"icon":{"default":{"id":"108"}},"type":46,"groupId":0,"id":52,"loading":false,"alpha":1,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"COLOR","pageId":"U3ymXf5BcQviOmmZ","lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":120,"width":45,"height":45},"action":29,"attributes":{"buttonLabel":"Visit our website for other best practices","color":"#cb6e14","media":[{"name":"Screenshot 2024-01-23 at 14.43.52.png","hash":"9957023f4bac3093cc4d127f45378805"}],"discountPrice":"","price":"","url":"https:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","radius":3,"title":"Best practice 7","loading":false,"description":"Invest in advanced analytics tools that can sift through vast datasets to uncover actionable insights.

From Contract Endings to New Beginnings: Automating Customer Retention Imagine a scenario where the process of customer retention is completely transformed by leveraging the right tools and adopting a circular sales approach. Traditionally, the expiration of a rental contract has been viewed as a point of friction for both manufacturers and customers. Why is that? Well, in most cases, there is a lack of regular communication between the two parties throughout the duration of the contract, resulting in a limited understanding of the customer's future needs and desires. In fact, a whopping 62% of customers feel that companies should step up their communication game, according to SuperOffice. To make matters worse, salespeople often find themselves in a challenging position when it comes to devising a refresh plan for their customers on a subscription plan. Without access to data and the appropriate reporting tools, creating an effective refresh strategy becomes a daunting task. Just picture this: salespeople are often left with incomplete information about the full device roadmap, unaware of the available residual value grid for the new devices, lacking real-time stock updates, and without comprehensive documentation regarding the customer's previous asset payments. As a result, contract expiration becomes a time-consuming hassle. www.blackwinch.eu Page 12 ","showCover":true,"comments":{},"guidelines":[],"lock":{"addElements":false,"removeElements":false,"reorderElements":false,"preventUnlock":false},"notes":{},"products":[]},"6fUbPlGw3yWXc0Y1":{"id":"6fUbPlGw3yWXc0Y1","type":"pdf","source":{"hash":"34a8cd85e0893b558c282di142302505","page":6},"width":795,"height":1123,"hash":"","version":"1","elements":[{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"ALPHA","pageId":"6fUbPlGw3yWXc0Y1","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":1058,"width":121,"height":15},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":false,"isAnnotation":false,"target":"_blank"},"zIndex":6,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":6,"alpha":0,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"6fUbPlGw3yWXc0Y1","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":96,"y":1058,"width":121,"height":15},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":true,"isAnnotation":false},"zIndex":21,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":21,"alpha":0.3,"rotation":0,"group":false}],"bgColor":"","extractedText":"In the realm of manufacturing, as in life, change is the only constant. Linear thinking, with its fixed plans and strategies, often leaves manufacturers unprepared and inflexible in the face of evolving circumstances. On the other hand, the circular mindset encourages a dynamic approach. It allows manufacturers to be agile and responsive, readily adapting to shifting market conditions, technological advancements, and the demands of their customers. In this context, change is not met with resistance but with readiness. Manufacturers employing a circular mindset position themselves to seize emerging opportunities, address challenges proactively, and align their offerings with the ever-evolving landscape of customer needs. This strategic agility is a cornerstone for continued success in today's rapidly changing business environment. 4. Circular Thinking Made Easy: Embracing As-A-Service Models As-A-Service models represent a paradigm shift in how manufacturers approach their business strategies and customer relationships. These models, which encompass delivering products, services, or solutions to customers through subscription-based arrangements, are inherently aligned with a circular mindset. Let's delve into the multifaceted reasons why As-A-Service models and circular thinking are harmoniously intertwined. Subscription-Based Relationships: A Shift from Transactional to Relational At the core of As-A-Service models lies a fundamental change in the nature of the customer-manufacturer relationship. In traditional transactional models, a customer purchases a product or service, and the interaction effectively ends there. However, As-A-Service models emphasize ongoing, subscription-based relationships. In this context, the customer transforms from a one-time buyer into a long-term partner. The recurring nature of subscriptions nurtures a sustained, meaningful connection. This transition from transactional to relational not only fosters trust but also encourages open, two-way communication. Customers are no longer seen as mere buyers but as active participants in a continuous dialogue with the manufacturer. Continuous Value Delivery: Meeting Evolving Needs As-A-Service models compel manufacturers to rethink their approach to value delivery. It's no longer about selling a product and moving on to the next customer. Instead, manufacturers are motivated to provide consistent value throughout the customer's journey. This value extends beyond the initial offering and encompasses ongoing improvements and adaptations to cater to the user's ever-evolving needs. This ongoing commitment to enhancing the customer's experience is at the heart of circular thinking. Manufacturers actively seek feedback, monitor usage patterns, and respond with meaningful adjustments. This continuous value delivery not only delights the customer but also strengthens the manufacturer's position as a trusted partner invested in the customer's success. Data-Driven Decisions: Personalization and Optimization Data analytics play a pivotal role in As-A-Service models, making them inherently data-driven and customer-centric.

Once the purchase is made, the process is considered complete. \u25cf Limited Interaction: Linear thinking tends to focus on limited interaction with consumers, mainly during the evaluation and purchase stages. It may not emphasize ongoing engagement beyond the point of sale. Circular Thinking \u25cf Continuous Loop: Circular thinking sees the consumer decision journey as an ongoing and cyclical process. It recognizes that consumers may reevaluate their choices, repeat stages, or engage with a product or service continuously. \u25cf No Fixed Endpoint: The circular approach does not assume a fixed endpoint. Instead, it acknowledges that the journey itself is the focus, and there's no clear separation between pre-purchase and post-purchase phases. \u25cf Ongoing Engagement: Circular thinking emphasizes continuous engagement with consumers, even after they make a purchase. This ongoing relationship-building and interaction are crucial components of the circular mindset. \u25cf Adaptability: Circular thinking allows for adaptation and flexibility. Consumers can re-enter the decision journey at any stage, reassess their needs, and make adjustments based on changing circumstances or preferences. Linear thinking follows a predefined path with a specific endpoint, while circular thinking sees the journey as an ongoing, adaptable cycle with a focus on continuous interaction and engagement. The choice between these mindsets often depends on the nature of the product or service, the consumer's decision-making behavior, and the brand's strategy for building and maintaining relationships with customers. www.blackwinch.eu Page 5 ","showCover":true,"comments":{},"guidelines":[],"lock":{"addElements":false,"removeElements":false,"reorderElements":false,"preventUnlock":false},"notes":{},"products":[]}}},"options":{"content":{"effect":"flip","layout":"smartView","hardCover":false,"rtl":false,"shadows":true,"sounds":true,"skinType":"default"},"controls":{"autoNavigationDelay":0,"slider":true,"animatedInteractions":true,"download":true,"toc":false,"search":true,"print":false,"showControls":true,"language":"English","fullScreen":true,"pagesOverview":true,"highlights":true,"share":true},"background":{"color":"#4e5565","opacity":1,"scale":"scaleCrop","type":"color","src":""},"logo":{"href":"","src":""},"shelf":{"color":"","width":640,"height":385,"item":{"width":640}},"restrictedDomainsSettings":{"useRestrictedDomains":false,"restrictedDomains":[]}},"leadForm":{"header":"Fill out this form to keep reading","placeholder":"Enter your email here","fields":[{"id":1,"fieldName":"Email address","validation":"email","required":true,"noOfRows":1,"valid":true,"userInput":""},{"id":2,"fieldName":"First and last name","validation":"none","required":true,"noOfRows":1},{"id":4,"fieldName":"Company name","validation":"none","required":true,"noOfRows":1}],"privacyPolicyActive":false,"privacyPolicyCompany":"","privacyPolicyWebsite":"","allowUsersToSkip":false,"skipButtonLabel":"Skip","label":"Submit","pageIndex":6,"active":false,"formVersion":1,"limit":"all","gdprActive":false,"gdprMessage":""},"draftModels":{},"features":{"FLIP_PAGES":500,"FLIP_FILES":500,"WIDGET_NO_WATERMARK":true,"WIDGET_RTL_ORIENTATION":true,"WIDGET_SINGLE_PAGE_VIEW":true,"WIDGET_SEARCH":true,"CUSTOM_FONTS":true,"WIDGET_SHELF":true,"WIDGET_LOGO":true,"WIDGET_PASSWORD":true,"WIDGET_ANALYTICS":true,"WIDGET_GTM":false,"WIDGET_PRINT":true,"WIDGET_MEDIA":true,"WIDGET_TAGS":true,"WIDGET_FORMS":true,"WIDGET_SHOPPING":false,"WIDGET_DOMAIN_RESTRICTIONS":false,"DOWNLOAD_PDF":true,"TABLE_OF_CONTENT":true,"LINKS_FROM_TEXT":true,"EMBED":false,"UPLOAD_VIDEO":false,"PRODUCT_TAG":true,"POPUP_FRAME":false,"CHARTS":true,"SLIDESHOW":true,"ADD_TO_CART":false,"PHOTO_SLIDESHOW":true,"SPOTLIGHT":true,"AUDIO_BACKGROUND":true,"CONTACT_FORM":false,"QUESTION":false,"QUIZ":false,"CUSTOM_PLAYER_COLORS":true,"ADD_TO_CART_ATTRIBUTES":false,"POLL":false,"LIST_SELLER_EMAILS":0,"BETA_TESTING":false,"SHELF_CUSTOM_BACKGROUND":true,"ZAPIER_INTEGRATION":false,"INTERNAL_TESTING":false,"MANDATORY_ACTIONS":false}}};
