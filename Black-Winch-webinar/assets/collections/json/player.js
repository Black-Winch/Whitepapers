Businesses should invest in understanding not just what customers say, but how they experience value. Theory vs. Practice: \u25cf Theory: Many companies believe they know what customers want based on industry trends and general feedback. \u25cf Practice: Philips initially launched their PaaS model without comprehensive customer research, leading to delays and misaligned product features.

Theory vs. Practice: \u25cf Theory: Economic theories suggest that predictable revenue models lead to greater nancial stability. \u25cf Practice: Mansard noted that while the theory holds true, the practice requires robust infrastructure to support subscription services. Companies must invest in customer relationship management and billing systems to avoid pitfalls in revenue collection and customer churn. 4.

Cinemas now prioritize customer-centric innovations rather than simply owning and upgrading their hardware. Actionable Insight: Businesses in hardware-heavy industries should explore ways to offer their products as a service. By focusing on customer outcomes rather than hardware sales, companies can unlock new value and build stronger, longer-lasting relationships with clients. Theory vs. Practice: \u25cf Theory: Companies traditionally rely on hardware sales for revenue, believing customers want the best equipment. \u25cf Practice: Barco\u2019s experience shows that customers prioritize outcomes, such as smooth operations and cost management, over owning the latest tech. The transition to as-a-service models aligned with their customers' business objectives. 2. Customer-Centric Value Delivery Overview: David Mackerness from Kaer emphasized a common mistake in product-based industries - focusing too much on the product's features instead of what truly matters to the customer: the outcomes and value it delivers. He shared how Kaer shifted from selling air conditioning units to providing a \"Cooling-as-a-Service\" solution after realizing customers were more interested in the comfort and business bene ts the cooling provided than the technical specs of the units. Key Webinar Testimonial from David Mackerness: Mackerness stated that customers prioritize their experience and the advantages they gain rather than the air conditioning systems themselves: We kept talking about air conditioning and how fantastic it was and how we could do things better and [our customers] didn't really care that much and they kept wanting to talk about their business and not really dive into the details of cooling.

This focus on the end result is a key driver behind the success of servitization models in industries like HVAC, healthcare, and technology (Salesforce, 2021). Actionable Insight: Listen to your customers' needs. Understand that while you may be passionate about the features of your product, customers often care more about the outcome your product enables. Align your offering with the tangible results they need for their business. Theory vs. Practice: \u25cf Theory: Traditional product-based businesses rely on differentiating products through better features, ef ciency, or innovation. The assumption is that if the product is superior, customers will naturally be attracted to it. \u25cf Practice: Customers don't always care about the inner workings of a product or its technical speci cations. What they truly value is the service it provides or the problem it solves. In real-world applications, companies that focus on delivering outcomes instead of features build stronger, longer-lasting relationships with their customers. The shift from a product to a service mindset is not just a strategic move, it's a necessary evolution to remain competitive in customer-centric markets. However, it requires substantial training and a cultural shift within the organization to achieve the right mindset. fi fi THE AS-A-SERVICE EXPERTS 5 ","showCover":true,"comments":{},"guidelines":[],"lock":{"addElements":false,"removeElements":false,"reorderElements":false,"preventUnlock":false},"notes":{},"products":[]}}},"options":{"content":{"effect":"flip","layout":"smartView","hardCover":false,"rtl":false,"shadows":true,"sounds":true,"skinType":"default","colors":null},"controls":{"slider":true,"navigationArrows":true,"download":true,"print":false,"fullScreen":true,"share":true,"search":true,"language":"English","autoNavigationDelay":0,"highlights":true,"showControls":true,"toc":false,"pagesOverview":true,"animatedInteractions":true},"restrictedDomainsSettings":{"useRestrictedDomains":false,"restrictedDomains":[]},"backgroundAudio":{"loop":false,"src":"","label":"","autoplay":false,"enabled":false},"background":{"color":"#4e5565","opacity":1,"scale":"scaleCrop","type":"color","src":""}},"leadForm":null,"draftModels":{},"features":{"FLIP_PAGES":500,"FLIP_FILES":500,"WIDGET_NO_WATERMARK":true,"WIDGET_RTL_ORIENTATION":true,"WIDGET_SINGLE_PAGE_VIEW":true,"WIDGET_SEARCH":true,"CUSTOM_FONTS":true,"WIDGET_SHELF":true,"WIDGET_LOGO":true,"WIDGET_PASSWORD":true,"WIDGET_ANALYTICS":true,"WIDGET_GTM":false,"WIDGET_PRINT":true,"WIDGET_MEDIA":true,"WIDGET_TAGS":true,"WIDGET_FORMS":true,"WIDGET_SHOPPING":false,"WIDGET_DOMAIN_RESTRICTIONS":false,"DOWNLOAD_PDF":true,"TABLE_OF_CONTENT":true,"LINKS_FROM_TEXT":true,"EMBED":false,"UPLOAD_VIDEO":false,"PRODUCT_TAG":true,"POPUP_FRAME":false,"CHARTS":true,"SLIDESHOW":true,"ADD_TO_CART":false,"PHOTO_SLIDESHOW":true,"SPOTLIGHT":true,"AUDIO_BACKGROUND":true,"CONTACT_FORM":false,"QUESTION":false,"QUIZ":false,"CUSTOM_PLAYER_COLORS":true,"ADD_TO_CART_ATTRIBUTES":false,"POLL":false,"LIST_SELLER_EMAILS":0,"BETA_TESTING":false,"SHELF_CUSTOM_BACKGROUND":true,"ZAPIER_INTEGRATION":false,"INTERNAL_TESTING":false,"MANDATORY_ACTIONS":false}}};
