Their activities are centered around coral reef restoration with coral gardening, artificial reef placement, coral fragment out planting onto artificial reefs, and marine protected area establishment.

Product-As-A-Service solutions motivate providers to build products that last long but the solution is no guarantee for a more sustainable use. \u25cf Since long life is desirable in both cases (Product-As-A-Service and traditional produce-sell model), the optimisation of the As-A-Service solution can risk resulting in planned obsolescence. It is especially true for products that are impacted by trends and fast-growing innovation. \u25cf As an example, If a car that is normally used for 3-5% of its lifetime is owned by a normal private person is instead shared or bought As-A-Service it can easily be used twice as much. For a PC or a refrigerator, it is not as easy. Ecodesign will help to prolong the life but if it is re-designed or refurbished it will not be the same product and it cannot be said that the original product version lasts longer. The EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts were published in November 2023 and the subpart about the product\u2019s lifespan has been modified in favor of a more simple direct criteria \u201cThe activity leads to an extended lifespan or increased use intensity of the product in practice.\u201d In the future, it would be interesting to refine these criteria per industry or product category with a clear quantified target to ensure that it is taken into account by manufacturers and providers.

The EU digital product passport's objective is to gather information about a product and its supply chain. All parties, including customers, may better understand the products they use and their environmental impact. During this discussion, we talked about asset definitions and the benefits the DPP can have for Product-As-A-Service.

This decentralization promotes a more inclusive workforce and reduces the need for resource-intensive office infrastructure. In essence, remote work not only enhances work-life balance but also plays a pivotal role in fostering a more sustainable and eco-friendly work environment. 7 ","showCover":true},"L2laQAkbUUPEwW4K":{"id":"L2laQAkbUUPEwW4K","type":"pdf","source":{"hash":"db308a5f56897471ca09aei142492855","page":0},"width":795,"height":1123,"hash":"","version":"1","elements":[{"layerLabel":"","level":0,"path":[],"update":"ALPHA","pageId":"L2laQAkbUUPEwW4K","lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":457,"y":235,"width":189.36170212765958,"height":127.65957446808511},"action":0,"attributes":{"tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF ","target":"_blank","showOptions":true,"url":"https:\/\/www.blackwinch.eu\/"},"zIndex":68,"icon":{"default":{"id":"100"}},"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":68,"alpha":0,"rotation":0,"group":false}],"bgColor":"","extractedText":"Annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2023 January 2024 ","showCover":true,"comments":{},"guidelines":[],"lock":{"addElements":false,"removeElements":false,"reorderElements":false,"preventUnlock":false},"notes":{},"products":[]},"TS9CTwMA2-D3syrQ":{"id":"TS9CTwMA2-D3syrQ","type":"pdf","source":{"hash":"db308a5f56897471ca09aei142492855","page":12},"width":795,"height":1123,"hash":"","version":"1","elements":[{"layerLabel":"","extractedLinksHidden":false,"isPageLocked":false,"pageIndex":12,"level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"TS9CTwMA2-D3syrQ","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":494,"y":207,"width":81,"height":20},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"https:\/\/unfccc.int\/documents\/271269","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":false,"isAnnotation":true,"target":"_blank"},"zIndex":85,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":27,"alpha":0,"rotation":0,"group":true},{"layerLabel":"","extractedLinksHidden":false,"isPageLocked":false,"pageIndex":12,"level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"TS9CTwMA2-D3syrQ","hidden":false,"lock":{"position":false,"style":false,"content":false,"preventUnlock":false},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":160,"y":230,"width":195,"height":20},"action":0,"attributes":{"url":"https:\/\/ghgprotocol.org\/","tooltip":"Outline","color":"#7BC2FF","isAutoLink":false,"isAnnotation":true},"zIndex":86,"type":0,"groupId":0,"id":28,"alpha":0,"rotation":0,"group":true},{"layerLabel":"","extractedLinksHidden":false,"isPageLocked":false,"pageIndex":12,"level":0,"path":[],"update":"COLOR","pageId":"TS9CTwMA2-D3syrQ","lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":88,"y":528,"width":557,"height":335},"action":25,"attributes":{"shape":1,"color":"#000000","repeat":false,"radius":0,"interaction":{},"mask":true},"zIndex":87,"icon":{},"type":50,"groupId":0,"id":84,"alpha":1,"rotation":0,"group":false},{"layerLabel":"","extractedLinksHidden":false,"isPageLocked":false,"pageIndex":12,"level":0,"path":[],"pageId":"TS9CTwMA2-D3syrQ","lock":{},"invisible":false,"bounds":{"x":205,"y":535,"width":399,"height":299},"action":16,"attributes":{"src":"aff3e90da4ab397af5c67d9f45483481","providerId":"","scaleMode":"none","provider":"","radius":0,"interaction":{},"thumb":"","format":"gif","subType":"upload"},"zIndex":88,"icon":{},"type":37,"groupId":0,"id":83,"alpha":1,"rotation":0,"group":false}],"bgColor":"","extractedText":"13 - Climate Action GHG emissions We monitor our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change GHG Calculator which is based on the GHG Protocol Standard (Scope 1, 2 and 3).

This act involved Product-As-A-Service by giving it a sustainable definition: Providing customers (physical person or legal person) with access to products through service models, which are either use-oriented services, where the product is still central, but its ownership remains with the provider and the product is leased, shared, rented or pooled; or result-oriented, where the payment is pre-defined and the agreed result (i.e. pay per service unit) is delivered.

Remote work, a key essence of Black Winch From the start, Black Winch has embraced remote work and doesn\u2019t have any office, resulting in lower energy consumption and reduced waste. Remote work contributes significantly to sustainability by reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional office setups. The shift to telecommuting minimizes the need for daily commuting, slashing carbon emissions and reducing traffic congestion. 6 ","showCover":true,"comments":{},"guidelines":[],"lock":{"addElements":false,"removeElements":false,"reorderElements":false,"preventUnlock":false},"notes":{},"products":[]},"l59TeWy8Xu6XzlpF":{"id":"l59TeWy8Xu6XzlpF","type":"pdf","source":{"hash":"db308a5f56897471ca09aei142492855","page":13},"width":795,"height":1123,"hash":"","version":"1","elements":[],"bgColor":"","extractedText":"accounting for 31,7%, comes from business travel.

When this happens, we strive to use more sustainable means of transportation and avoid taking the plane when possible. 9

We recognize that our actions have an impact, and we must ensure that this impact is a positive one. At the heart of our business is the As-A-Service circular business model. This model is a key component of the circular economy, particularly due to its focus on centralized ownership. By placing the product's life cycle in the hands of the manufacturer or integrator, we can guarantee that the end of life is properly managed through practices such as reuse, recycling, and refurbishment. In 2023, we remained committed to our mission of achieving ambitious social and sustainability goals. We worked tirelessly to align our corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities with our business objectives and values. By doing so, we strive to make a meaningful and lasting impact on the world around us. Black Winch is the world's exclusive authority in Product-As-A-Service solutions. Sustainability is part of Black Winch\u2019s values, and the company\u2019s governance reflects its CSR ambitions. In the following pages, we report on our progress toward our goals. We remain committed to helping address societal and environmental challenges and to reporting on our progress as a participant and supporter of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
